Beijing PM2.5

The dataset contains hourly weather data from the Beijing Capital International Airport weather station, along with the corresponding PM2.5 concentration levels. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair. These particles are considered particularly harmful due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered, causing health problems.

Missing data are denoted as "NA".
